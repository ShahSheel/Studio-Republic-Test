# Studio-Republic-Test

## Time Taken
 1 day and 3 hours

## Prerequisites (Ie needed to learn Tailwind, Flexbox, grids)

* Needed to perform discovery and learn Tailwind, Flex, Grids. I am from a background where I build CSS/SASS for components. Having to learn Flex (I still don't fully understand as you can tell from my code) was hard for me. 

## Planning 

* Firstly i debtated which would be quicker to deploy. HTML or VueJS. I was lienient on VueJS since I have experience using this since my HTML5 skills are now very rusty (Haven't touched HTML5 in 3 years), but I chose to use HTML5 as it's easier to set up Gulp for this. 
* After choosing the stack, I looked at the Figma and created 2-3 columns depending on the section, with `divs` containing a `container` that allows the image and text to be wrapped in the `div` and would then `float` where neccessary. 
* I then sketched out what it will look on mobile using this skelenton and tried to do a mobile first approach. 
* After doing the planning, I read the documentation of Tailwind and tried to use Flex but it all went pear shaped..


## Serving
```
npm run dev 
``` 

## Building Production

```
npm run build
```


## If I had more time, what would I do differently?

* Look up Flex in more great detail
* Look up best practises for frontend development
* Use a framework that supports for loops (This is should be #1 for me)
